# Create New Task
## Main Success Scenario
1. User wants to create a new TODO task.
2. User initiates task creation.
3. User fills task description (title).
4. User defines priority (defaults to low).
5. Optionally, user can add one or more tags.
4. User saves the task.

### Alternative: Validation Failed
* At step 3 the title is empty and therefore considered invalid.
* Allow the user to enter the title again.
